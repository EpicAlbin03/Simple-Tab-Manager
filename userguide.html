              Please note that all settings are global, so any changes you save will be applied to all open windows. Similarly, the selected sorting options
              will also be saved and automatically applied when opening the extension again.
            </p>

            <!-- Select All -->
            <h6>Select All</h6>
            <p>Selects all tabs. If all tabs are selected then unselect all of them.</p>

            <!-- Copy Urls -->
            <h6>Copy Urls</h6>
            <p>Copies the urls of the selected tabs to clipboard in form of a list.</p>

            <!-- Grouping options -->
            <h4 class="pt-2">Grouping options</h4>
            <h6>Add to new group</h6>
            <p>Selected tabs will be added to a new group. Name and color is optional.</p>
            <h6>Add to existing group</h6>
            <p>Specify the name of the group and the selected tabs will be added to that group.</p>
            <h6>Remove from group</h6>

            <h6>Ungroup</h6>
            <p>Specify the name of the group and all groups with that name will be ungrouped. The groups will be removed but the tabs will stay intact.</p>
            <h6>Close group</h6>
            <p>Specify the name of the group and all groups with that name will be closed. The groups, along with the tabs, will be removed.</p>
            <h6>Add to new window</h6>
            <p>Selected tabs will be added to a new window. Name is unavailable.</p>

            <!-- Sorting options -->
            <h4 class="pt-2">Sorting options</h4>
            <h6>Sort by title</h6>
            <p>
              Sorts all tabs in the current window alphabetically by their titles. Tabs within groups will be unaffected if "Preserve order within groups"
              option is selected.
            </p>
            <h6>Sort by url</h6>
            <p>
              Sorts all tabs in the current window alphabetically by their urls. The tabs will be sorted by their hostname excluding things like "www" (see
              example below). Tabs within groups will be unaffected if "Preserve order within groups" option is selected.

            <!-- Settings -->
            <h4 class="pt-2">Settings</h4>
            <h6>Automatically sort tabs</h6>
            <p>
              All tabs in the current window will be automatically sorted after the currently selected sorting option (title or url) after [x] amount of time.
              For example if sec = 30, the tabs will be sorted every 30 seconds. Please note that at least one of "sec", "min" or "hours" has to be > 0.
            </p>
            <h6>Preserve order within groups</h6>
            <p>
              If this option is selected, groups will be unaffected by sorting. All groups will be moved to the left most positions and be sorted in
              alphabetical order. All tabs within groups will remain in the same order while the rest of the tabs will be sorted normally. If this option is
              unselected, groups won't be accounted for when sorting and will most likely ungroup tabs.
